## Features

[x] Load new set of posts whenever current set is near end. So basically continuous paging.

    - Above is about done, I dont know if the ordering is wrong but I think It's good. We can't test this right now to ensure I'm not aimlessly testing.
    - We are keeping the actual load button for now encase our scroll detector doesnt work.

[ ] User profiles... load GitHub bio on first login to description and allow changing.
[ ] MAYBE site staff badge on tweets or special color.
[ ] Allow following users so you only see their tweets. Site staff tweets will always be seen no matter if following or not.
[ ] Allow posts to be liked
[ ] Comments and nested comments... hopefully.
[ ] Eventually a UI overhaul... most likely with React or Vue.

## Quality of Life

[ ] Hide Load button if theres not all posts there or no posts.
[ ] Add a "SYSTEM" message if no posts are found.
[ ] Mobile.. this is in QOL because I am honestly too lazy to prioritize it... sorry mobile users.
